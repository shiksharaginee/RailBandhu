# RailBandhu

This project is a mini railway reservation system based on Indian Railway Ticket Reservation System implemented using SQL. It allows users to book and cancel train tickets, manage seat availability, track revenue, and handle waitlists. The system simulates the core functionalities of a real-world railway ticketing platform, designed for learning and demonstration purposes.
