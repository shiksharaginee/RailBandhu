This project is a mini railway reservation system based on Indian Railway Ticket Reservation System implemented using SQL. It allows users to book and cancel train tickets, manage seat availability, track revenue, and handle waitlists. The system simulates the core functionalities of a real-world railway ticketing platform, designed for learning and demonstration purposes.

Key Features:
1. Ticket Booking – Users can book tickets based on train, class, date, and number of passengers.
2. Ticket Cancellation – Booked tickets can be cancelled; the system automatically updates availability and waitlist accordingly.
3. Seat Availability Check – Users can check how many seats are available in a given class of a train on a specific date.
4. Waitlist Management – If seats are unavailable, bookings are placed on a waitlist and promoted automatically when cancellations occur.
5. Refund Management – Refunds are calculated based on cancellation timing and rules.
6. Revenue Tracking – Tracks revenue generated per train, per date, and overall.
7. Comprehensive Reporting – Includes queries for top earning trains, fully booked trains, most popular routes, and more.
